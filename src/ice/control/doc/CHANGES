Releases
========


0.3.0 (unreleased)
------------------

Namespace `++control++` instead of `++etc++control`.
Transitive security for IControl (10x location proxy).
Transitive access to content context from IControl (method get_content()).
Use controls not only on root folder, but on any content.
Allow nested (recursive) namespaces, i.e. '++control++/++control++' and etc.
Used accurate permissions in all views.
Explicit layer definition in skin's views.
Added ZODB Pack control.
Added Ctrl+E keybinding in REPL ("go to line end")
Auto scrolling in REPL.

In summary, it can now be used as pluggable CMS UI for users with
different permissions and roles, not only zope.Manager, from any nested
content object, not only root folder, and UI should correctly display menu
items and views accordingly to context and permissions.
